**Alchemy**: Distillation of weird chemical mixtures.
**Demon**: Possibly the first beings, from before the origin of reality. Not echoed in the ghost field; their blood contains electroplasmic essence, giving them eternal life. Each obsessed with its dark desire; some think of them as living embodiments of those desires, not truly “people” at all.
**Devil**: Anything supernatural or disturbing (thus, a devil’s bargain).
**Electroplasm**: Energetic residue distilled from ghosts and leviathan blood.
**Ghost**: Spirit without a body, craving life essence and vengeance. Semi-solid electroplasmic vapor. Suffers limited harm from physical attacks, but vulnerable to electricity and arcane powers.
**Ghost Field**: The strange dimension which erupted during the cataclysm.
**Hollow**: Living body without a spirit. Usually dim-witted / easily controlled.
**Hull**: A sparkcraft body animated by a bound spirit. 
**Possessed**: A living body containing two (or more) spirits.
**Rituals**: Ancient occult compacts to entreat demonic / otherworldly assistance.
**Soul**: A living body with its own spirit. (The normal state of affairs.)
**Sparkcraft**: The distillation of spectrology, rituals, and/or alchemy with technological engineering.
**Spectrology**: Control of spiritual energies / ghosts with pseudo-scientific techniques.
**Spirit Wardens**: Seek to recover bodies before the spirit becomes a ghost. Their masks are attuned to the Spirit Bells which ring when someone dies in the city (which can also be heard by those near the death). Deathseeker crows fly from their belfries to circle ever closer to the corpse.
**Spirit Well**: A rift in the veil of reality where ghosts and other supernatural beings congregate. In ancient myth, a spawning ground for demons.
**Vampire**: A dead body animated and sustained by as spirit.
