module.exports.barrowcleft = `**Barrowcleft**
Residences and markets for the farmers who work the fields and eeleries.
+1d to acquire an asset, but gain +2 HEAT. (One of the best marketplaces, but criminals attract attention.)

Barrowcleft is the home to the laborers and overseers of the Ministry of Preservation who attend the radiant energy farms of Doskvol. It is a dusty, rural district, with simple wooden buildings of only one or two stories and wide dirt roads to accommodate large cargo wagons. The farmers of Barrowcleft are organized into tight-knit family-based clans that are proud of their vital role in the city’s welfare and hold themselves apart from the “city folk” across the river. Outsiders are welcome here for honest trade, but are met with a cold suspicion otherwise.`;

module.exports.brightstone = `**Brightstone**
The grand mansions and luxury shops of the wealthy elite.
-1d on engagement rolls; operations vs. nobles are hostile turf. (Heavy Bluecoat patrols.)

Brightstone is home to many of the wealthiest and most influential citizens of Doskvol. Its streets are broad and paved, under bright electric lights; its canals are sparkling and clean, with perfumed water; its houses are all of fine, pale marble blocks, rich timbers, and intricate ironworks. There are cultivated parks fed by radiant energy; lavish restaurants and cafes; jewelers, tailors, and other luxury shops. Street-side vendors are forbidden here, resulting in a serene, spacious atmosphere, punctuated by the occasional carriage or marching Bluecoat patrol.`;

module.exports.charhallow = `**Charhallow**
A maze of tenements and squalid row houses.
Operations vs. citizenry are hostile turf.

This crowded district is home to the bulk of the workforce of the city—servants, dockers, sailors, stockyard and eelery workers, cabbies, and so on. It’s cheap, noisy, cramped, and sweltering from cookfires and hissing steam-pipes, but there’s a familial camaraderie among its residents that you won’t find anywhere else. The people of Charhollow are a true community, brought together by circumstance, but bound by ties of mutual support and care in stark contrast to the cutthroat ruthlessness that constitutes business as usual in the rest of the city.`;

module.exports.charterhall = `**Charterhall**
The city’s civic offices and the hub for shops, artisans, and commerce.
Devil’s bargain for +1d to gather information from records for 1 HEAT. 

Charterhall is the site of the first major construction in the city, in the days before the cataclysm. The old wall upon which was built the first lightning barrier in the Empire still stands in partial ruin around the district. The area is now home to the civic offices of the government including the courts, licensing and taxation offices, banks, and records archives. City officials and students at Charterhall University live here, along with the captains of Imperial industry who prefer to reside within sight of their fortunes.`;

module.exports.coalridge = `**Coalridge**
The remnants of Doskvol’s original hilltop mining settlement, now home to laborers and industrial factories.

Coalridge is home to most of the machinists, industrial laborers, and factories of the city. It’s cramped, soot-choked, and loud—spewing dense clouds of black smoke, showers of sparks, and burning cinders. The old elevated train lines that once hauled coal now carry heavy equipment and raw materials to and from Gaddoc Station, though many of the ancient tracks and cars have been abandoned to squatters who’ve converted them into makeshift homes.`;

module.exports.crowsfoot = `**Crow's Foot**
A cramped neighborhood of multi-level streets, ruled by gangs
Devil’s bargain for +1d for violent action, but ghost will lash out. (Years of murder have made this the most haunted district.)

Crow’s Foot is a crossroads, merging many qualities of its neighboring districts: the illict vices of Silkshore, the labor and trade of the Docks, the poverty of Charhollow, and the classic architecture of Charterhall. The district is a patchwork, both held together and threatened to be torn apart by the menagerie of competing street gangs and Bluecoat squads that claim every avenue and corner as territory in an endless turf war.`;

module.exports.docks = `**Docks**
Rough taverns, tattoo parlors, fighting pits, and warehouses.
Operations vs. ships at port are hostile turf.

The docks of Doskvol are ancient, going back to the days before the cataclysm, when the area was a colony town of the old Skov kingdom. Today, some commerce has shifted to the new electro-rail lines of the Imperium, but the docks are still bustling with cargo haulers, fishing boats, and the prestigious leviathan hunter ships that provide the raw material that keeps the city running.`;

module.exports.dunslough = `**Dunslough**
A labor camp served by convicts and a ghetto for the destitute poor.

Dunslough is a ghetto for the destitute poor of the city, as well as the site of Ironhook Prison and its labor camp. Originally, the ghetto was a neighborhood for families of prisoners, but over the years, extreme poverty and neglect have worn it down into a sodden ruin. A vicious cycle plays out here: crime driven by desperation, then arrest, incarceration, and release back to Dunslough—giving Ironhook an endless supply of laborers to exploit.`;

module.exports.nightmarket = `**Nightmarket**
The trade center for exotic goods imported by rail. Many vendors also trade in illicit goods.
+1d to acquire an asset, but gain 2 stress. (Best place to trade illicit and arcane goods, but corners are full of strange horrors.)

Nightmarket is a district dominated by commerce. Situated near Gaddoc Rail Station, Nightmarket receives the bulk of salable goods from the cargo trains that travel across the Imperium, bringing the exotic and rare to Duskwall. The citizens that call Nightmarket home constitute a new class of “elites”—wealthy people who are not of noble descent but nevertheless claim land, status, and power without titles. The district has been taken over by new construction, introducing lavish private townhouses with all of the modern advances for the elites that can afford them.`;

module.exports.silkshore = `**Silkshore**
The “red lamp district” and artist community.
If you overindulge your vice, +1d to your roll next time you indulge here.

Criss-crossed by dozens of narrow canals, Silkshore is a district best navigated by gondola, as most visitors to this “red lamp district” do. The brothels, vice dens, food stalls, and exotic shops all perch at the waterside, ready to satisfy the appetites of their clientele, no questions asked. Silkshore is a place of public indulgence and private indelicacy, catering to every pleasure imaginable—as well as some that strain the bounds of fantasy.`;

module.exports.sixtowers = `**Six Towers**
A formerly rich district, now worn down and dilapidated.

This formerly prestigious district has faded over the centuries into a pale shadow of what it once was. The eponymous six towers were originally the grand residences of Doskvol’s first noble families. All but two (Bowmore House and Rowan House) have been sold off and converted into cheap apartments or fallen into ruin and abandoned. The district has an empty, haunted feel, with many sprawling old buildings dark without power, broad stone streets cracked and buckled, and the fires of squatters crackling from overgrown lots.`;

module.exports.Whitecrown = `**Whitecrown**
The sprawling estates of the Lord Governor, Hunter Commander, Master Warden, and Doskvol Academy.
-2d on engagement rolls; operations vs. nobles are hostile turf. (Heavy Bluecoat patrols.)

Whitecrown sits atop a grand peak on the island across North Hook channel from the city proper. From this lofty height, the Lord Governor’s stronghold oversees all, flanked by the grand estates of the most powerful nobility and the extravagantly appointed campus of Doskvol Academy. Whitecrown is a rich and rarefied world unto itself—most citizens live out their entire lives in the city without ever once crossing the bridge to the glittering spires of wealth and power there.`;
