module.exports.char2 = `**2. Choose a heritage.**
Your character’s heritage describes where their family line is from. You may be of any heritage of your choice, and then decide if you’re a foreigner who has immigrated to Doskvol or if you’re a local who grew up here. When you choose a heritage, circle it on the list on your playbook, then write a detail about your family life on the line above. For example, you might choose Skovlan heritage, and then write Factory workers from Lockport, now refugees. Or you might choose Iruvian heritage and write Exiled nobility. Each heritage is described in the commands below.

\` $akoros \` Akorosi.
\` $daggerisles \` Dagger Islander.

Choose one of the general background options from the list on your playbook, then write a detail about it that’s specific to your character. For example, you could choose Labor, and then write Leviathan hunter sailor, mutineer. Or you might choose Law and write Former Bluecoat. See more examples below.

module.exports.char4 = `**4. Assign four dots.**
Your playbook begins with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you’ll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots (unless a special ability tells you otherwise). Brief descriptions of all the actions can be found through \` $actions \`
Assign your four dots like this:

Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s heritage.
Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s background.
Assign two more dots anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).`;

module.exports.char5 = `**5. Choose a special ability.**
Take a look at the special abilities for your playbook and choose one. If you can’t decide which one to pick, go with the first one on the list—it’s placed there as a good default choice.`;

module.exports.char6 = `**6. Choose a close friend & a rival.**
Each playbook has a list of NPCs that your character knows. Choose one from the list who is a close relationship (a good friend, a lover, a family relation, etc.). Mark the upward-pointing triangle next to their name. Then choose another NPC on the list who’s your rival or enemy. Mark the downward-pointing triangle next to their name.`;

module.exports.char7 = `**7. Choose your vice.**
Every scoundrel is in thrall to some vice or another, which they indulge to deal with stress. Choose a vice from the list, and describe it on the line above with the specific details and the name and location of your vice purveyor in the city. For example, you might choose Gambling, then write Spogg’s dice game, Crow’s Foot. You can create a vice purveyor or ask the GM to tell you about a couple likely options for your vice. See a detailed list of vice purveyors \` $faith \`, \` $weird \`, etc.

**Faith**: You’re dedicated to an unseen power, forgotten god, ancestor, etc.
**Gambling**: You crave games of chance, betting on sporting events, etc.
**Luxury**: Expensive or ostentatious displays of opulence.
**Obligation**: You’re devoted to a family, a cause, an organization, a charity, etc.
**Pleasure**: Gratification from lovers, food, drink, drugs, art, theater, etc.
**Stupor**: You seek oblivion in the abuse of drugs, drinking to excess, getting beaten to a pulp in the fighting pits, etc.
**Weird**: You experiment with strange essences, consort with rogue spirits, observe bizarre rituals or taboos, etc.`;

module.exports.char8 = `**8. Record your name, alias, and look.**
Choose a name for your character from the sample list (\` $names \`), or create your own. If your character uses an alias or nickname in the underworld, make a note of it. Record a few evocative words that describe your character’s look (samples provided on the next page).`;

module.exports.char9 = `**9. Review your details.**
Take a look at the details on your character sheet, especially the experience triggers for your playbook (like “Earn xp when you address a challenge with knowledge or arcane power,” for example) and the special items available to a character of your type (like the Whisper’s spirit mask, for example). You begin with access to all of the items on your sheet, so don’t worry about picking specific things—you’ll decide what your character is carrying later on, when you’re on the job (see Loadout, page 57).

That’s it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM will ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don’t know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.`;
