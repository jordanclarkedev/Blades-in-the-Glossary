module.exports.arrest = `**Arrest**
An Inspector presents a case file of evidence to a magistrate, to begin prosecution of your crew. The Bluecoats send a detail to arrest you (a gang at least equal in scale to your wanted level). Pay them off with coin equal to your wanted level +3, hand someone over for arrest (this clears your heat), or try to evade capture.`;

module.exports.cooperation = `**Cooperation**
A +3 status faction asks you for a favor. Agree to do it, or forfeit 1 rep per Tier of the friendly faction, or lose 1 status with them. If you don’t have a +3 faction status, you avoid entanglements right now.`;

module.exports.demonicnotice = `**Demonic Notice**
A demon approaches the crew with a dark offer. Accept their bargain, hide until it loses interest (forfeit 3 rep), or deal with it another way.`;

module.exports.flipped = `**Flipped**
One of the PCs’ rivals arranges for one of your contacts, patrons, clients, or a group of your customers to switch allegiances due to the heat on you. They’re loyal to another faction now.`;

module.exports.gangtrouble = `**Gang Trouble**
One of your gangs (or other cohorts) causes trouble due to their flaw(s). You can lose face (forfeit rep equal to your Tier +1), make an example of one of the gang members, or face reprisals from the wronged party.`;

module.exports.interrogation = `**Interrogation**
The Bluecoats round up one of the PCs to question them about the crew’s crimes. How did they manage to capture you? Either pay them off with 3 coin, or they beat you up (level 2 harm) and you tell them what they want to know (+3 heat). You can resist each of those consequences separately.`;

module.exports.questioning = `**Questioning**
The Bluecoats grab an NPC member of your crew or one of the crew’s contacts, to question them about your crimes. Who do the Bluecoats think is most vulnerable? Make a fortune roll to see how much they talk (1-3: +2 heat, 4/5: +1 heat), or pay the Bluecoats off with 2 coin.`;

module.exports.reprisals = `**Reprisals**
An enemy faction makes a move against you (or a friend, contact, or vice purveyor). Pay them (1 rep and 1 coin) per Tier of the enemy as an apology, allow them to mess with you or yours, or fight back and show them who’s boss.`;

module.exports.rivals = `**Rivals**
A neutral faction throws their weight around. They threaten you, a friend, a contact, or one of your vice purveyors. Forfeit (1 rep or 1 coin) per Tier of the rival, or stand up to them and lose 1 status with them.`;

module.exports.showofforce = `**Show of Force**
A faction with whom you have a negative status makes a play against your holdings. Give them 1 claim or go to war (drop to -3 status). If you have no claims, lose 1 hold instead.`;

module.exports.unquietdead = `**Unquiet Dead**
A rogue spirit is drawn to you—perhaps it’s a past victim? Acquire the services of a Whisper or Rail Jack to attempt to destroy or banish it, or deal with it yourself.`;

module.exports.usualsuspects = `**Usual Suspects**
The Bluecoats grab someone in the periphery of your crew. One player volunteers a friend or vice purveyor as the person most likely to be taken. Make a fortune roll to find out if they resist questioning (1-3: +2 heat, 4/5: level 2 harm), or pay the Bluecoats off with 1 coin.`;
