# Blades in the Dark Helper
A Discord bot to make running Blades in the Dark easier.

Designed to help newer players more easily understand their character and crew sheet, and to reduce the GM's need to look information up. Incorporates a lot of information from the [Blades in the Dark Cheatsheet](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/41025/roleplaying-games/blades-in-the-dark-system-cheat-sheet-v3).

Recommended use alongside [Blades in the Dicebot](https://github.com/jordanclarkedev/bitdicebot), and Clocks in the Dark.

If you've found any issues or improvements it could use, file a bug!
