module.exports.char2 = `**2. Choose a heritage.**
Your character’s heritage describes where their family line is from. You may be of any heritage of your choice, and then decide if you’re a foreigner who has immigrated to Doskvol or if you’re a local who grew up here. When you choose a heritage, circle it on the list on your playbook, then write a detail about your family life on the line above. For example, you might choose Skovlan heritage, and then write Factory workers from Lockport, now refugees. Or you might choose Iruvian heritage and write Exiled nobility. Each heritage is described in brief, below. For more details about these people and places, see page 308.

**Akorosi**: Akoros is the largest and most industrialized land in the Imperium, and is home to the capitol city as well as Duskwall itself. They’re known as a diverse conglomeration of cultures that have grown together in close proximity for centuries, somewhat like Europe.

**Dagger Islander**: If you want to be a rootless wanderer you could be from the Dagger Isles. People there often grow up on ships and travel a lot before settling down. They’re known as corsairs and merchants who live without lightning barriers— dealing with spirits in other ways.

**Iruvian**: If you want to be from a culture considered “foreign” by the locals, you could be from Iruvia, a rich and powerful desert kingdom far to the south. It’s another diverse land of varying cultures similar to old Persia, Egypt, and India.

**Severosi**: If you want to be from a place considered “wild” by the rest of the empire, you could be from Severos. Outside the few Imperial settlements, most Severosi live in nomadic horse-tribes scattered across the blasted deathlands, surviving within the ruins of ancient arcane fortresses which still repel spirits.

**Skovlander**: If you want to be from a marginalized people, you could be from Skovlan, the island kingdom just across the sea from Doskvol. Skovlan was last to be brought under Imperial rule, over the course of the 36-year Unity War (which ended only a few years ago). Many Skovlander refugees who lost their homes and jobs in the destruction of the war have come to Doskvol seeking new opportunities.

**Tycherosi**: If you want to be weird, you can be from Tycheros. It’s a semi-mythical place, far away beyond the northern Void Sea. Everyone says that the people there are part-demon. If you choose Tycherosi heritage, also create a demonic telltale (like black shark eyes, feathers instead of hair, etc.) that marks your character.
`;

module.exports.char3 = `**3. Choose a background.**
Your character’s background describes what they did before they joined the crew. Choose one of the general background options from the list on your playbook, then write a detail about it that’s specific to your character. For example, you could choose Labor, and then write Leviathan hunter sailor, mutineer. Or you might choose Law and write Former Bluecoat. See more examples below.

**Academic**: A scholar, a professor or student from Doskvol Academy, a philosopher or journalist, etc.

**Labor**: A servant, a factory worker, a coach driver, a docker, a sailor, a Rail Jack, etc. A stevedore for the North Hook Company.

**Noble**: A dilettante, a courtier, the scion of a fallen house, etc. Underworld: A street urchin, gang member, young thug, or other outcast who grew up on the streets.

module.exports.char4 = `**4. Assign four dots.**
Your playbook begins with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you’ll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots (unless a special ability tells you otherwise). Brief descriptions of all the actions follow, on pages 58 and 59. Assign your four dots like this:

Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s heritage.

Assign two more dots anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).`;

Each playbook has a list of NPCs that your character knows. Choose one from the list who is a close relationship (a good friend, a lover, a family relation, etc.). Mark the upward-pointing triangle next to their name. Then choose another NPC on the list who’s your rival or enemy. Mark the downward-pointing triangle next to their name.
`;
module.exports.char7 = `**7. Choose your vice.**
Every scoundrel is in thrall to some vice or another, which they indulge to deal with stress. Choose a vice from the list, and describe it on the line above with the specific details and the name and location of your vice purveyor in the city. For example, you might choose Gambling, then write Spogg’s dice game, Crow’s Foot. You can create a vice purveyor or ask the GM to tell you about a couple likely options for your vice. See a detailed list of vice purveyors on page 299.

`;
module.exports.char9 = `**9. Review your details.**
Take a look at the details on your character sheet, especially the experience triggers for your playbook (like “Earn xp when you address a challenge with knowledge or arcane power,” for example) and the special items available to a character of your type (like the Whisper’s spirit mask, for example). You begin with access to all of the items on your sheet, so don’t worry about picking specific things—you’ll decide what your character is carrying later on, when you’re on the job (see Loadout, page 57).

That’s it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM will ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don’t know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.`
